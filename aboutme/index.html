    <p>Hello, my name is Edgar and I am Venezuelan but I live in Peru the city of Lima. It is my first semester in my career in Applied Technology. </p>
    <p>I am a math teacher, but I have always liked technology, decided to enter this new world and boost my professional opportunities</p>
    <p>Some of the things I like are music, learning, listening to books, jumping rope, video games, watching anime, and movies.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was 25 years old, every day I try to increase my faith and obedience, my favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7</p>
    <p>I hope we all get along and have a great semester. Thank you for viewing my website.</p>
